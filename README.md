## About

**Way Escape** is a small 2D prototype I built in **2019** while learning Unity. It’s the first game I ever finished and shipped as a demo. I combined assets from the Unity Asset Store and the web, learned core concepts via a Udemy course, and iterated with my own ideas to shape the gameplay.

This project marks the starting point of my journey to become a game developer—simple, but meaningful.

## Features (Demo)

- 2D platforming with simple, readable controls  
- Short level(s) to showcase the core mechanic  
- Lightweight visuals using public assets  
- WebGL build so you can play instantly

## How to Play

- **Move/Jump:** WASD/Arrow Keys + Space  
- **Goal:** Navigate the level and find the way out  
- **Tip:** Explore—it's a short demo, so try a few runs

> If your build uses different controls, update this section to match.

## Status & Roadmap

This demo represents an early prototype from 2019. Planned ideas back then:
- A simple story thread
- More levels/mechanics
- UI/UX polish

I may revisit it for a small “remaster” to reflect what I’ve learned since.

## Tech

- **Engine:** Unity (2D)  
- **Platforms:** Windows, WebGL
